1.	Motivate HAR
2.	What is hard about HAR data
3.	GAN can solve this issues
4.	Previous HAR GANs is not tailored twrds continuous/discrete (designed for images, don’t do discrete)
5.	If we could have discrete features + cont
6.	Proof


Ideas for visuals:
Left:
Priaception – phone in hand (on/off)
Phone in hand, phone in pocket, smartchwatch


Center:
Use of discrete+continuous->
Data still -> 
Data still + nighttime -> sleeping


Right:
How diverse (how much variance, results equivalent to the one trained on real data)
How well it impacts model (how much better against baseline)
SVM: how separable
Inception
