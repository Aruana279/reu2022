1.	IEEE conference- sep 15th (special session)
2.	August 15th-complete computational work
3.	Feature engineering (SHAP score, random forest)
4.	Experiments
a.	Tabular on Extra Sensory
b.	Per user analysis
c.	First week of a user’s 
d.	What features to use
e.	Machine evaluation
i.	Train on real, test fake.
ii.	Train fake, test real
iii.	Train real+fake, test real vs Train real, test real
f.	Inception score
g.	Maybe: FID score
5.	Vanilla GANs on every class vs Tabular GAN
6.	Conditional and controllable GAN vs Tabular GAN
7.	Draft paper

July 5th- request Turing at WPI
July 7th- working Tabular GAN
July 8th- feature importance (modular so can change number of features)
July 12th- every method run on important features for all users
July 15th- every method run on individual users
July 18th – rough draft with poster
July 20th -machine eval pipelines
July 22nd – inception score
July 25th – final poster + paper intro
July 27th – final results + comparison of GANs
August 3rd- finalize everything
